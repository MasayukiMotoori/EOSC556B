This is git hub repository for Project.  
Inversion of Induced Polarization(IP) parameter from TDEM.
IP models are based on cole-cole or pelton model
Model are based on deep Sea Massive Sulfide exploration inspired by JOGMEC survey.

Steepest descend and Gauss-Newton method are available for optimization.
Jacobian is approximated by finite difference.
Plotting functions about objective value grids are also prepared.

## Components
1. python file ("project.py"):
   Users are supposed to install Python file to use this code.
2. Jupyternotebooks are examples of how to use.
